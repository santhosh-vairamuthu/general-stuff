Temperature Anomaly Classification using Decision Trees

Introduction:
This project focuses on building a classification model using decision trees to predict temperature anomalies based on various features. The dataset used contains historical temperature data, and the objective is to classify temperature anomalies into predefined categories using decision tree classification techniques.

Dataset:
The dataset utilized in this project contains temperature measurements spanning different years and months. It includes features like "Monthly Anomaly," "Monthly Uncertainty," "Annual Anomaly," "Annual Uncertainty," and more. The dataset's attributes provide insights into the variations and anomalies present in historical temperature data.

Problem Statement:
The core problem tackled in this project is the classification of temperature anomalies based on specific thresholds and ranges. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to categorize temperature anomalies into distinct classes, allowing us to identify patterns and trends within the data.

Approach:
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv function.
Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and data cleanup are performed.
Feature Engineering:
A new column named "Class" is introduced to the dataset to hold the classification labels.
Classification categories are determined based on specific conditions applied to the features, including "Monthly Anomaly" and "Annual Anomaly."
Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing subsets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
Model Building:
A DecisionTreeClassifier is instantiated from scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier class.
The classifier is trained on the training dataset using the fit method.
Model Evaluation:
Predictions are generated for the test dataset using the trained classifier's predict method.
The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the accuracy_score metric from scikit-learn's metrics module.
Results and Analysis:
The accuracy of the classification model provides an indication of its performance in classifying temperature anomalies.
The classification results are analyzed to determine how well the model's predictions align with the actual classifications.
Insights are drawn from the model's decision-making process by visualizing the decision tree structure.
Conclusion:
By leveraging decision tree classification, this project successfully addresses the classification of temperature anomalies using historical temperature data. The code implementation and documentation showcase fundamental steps in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The project serves as a foundation for learning and experimenting with classification techniques in the context of data science.

Future Steps:
To further enhance this project, consider exploring the following avenues:

Investigate different classification algorithms, such as random forests or support vector machines.
Conduct deeper exploratory data analysis to identify hidden patterns within the dataset.
